# Condtributing to Solarized Chandrian IntelliJ IDEA

## Build the Plugin JAR file

1. To compile the templates into the `dist/` directory, run 

```
npm run compile
```

2. Using IDEA, build the project to populate the `out/` directory.

3. Prepare the "solarized-chandrian-theme" plugin module for deployment.

## Testing
