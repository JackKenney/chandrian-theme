# Solarized Chandrian VS Code Color Theme

A mix of the chandrian theme from https://github.com/narenranjit/chandrian-theme and the solarized colors https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/. 
Some of the colors are increased so they have a contrast ratio of about 5:1, for readability, but also kept around 4.5:1 where necessary to keep the hue visible.

There is both a dark and light version, with the color-hues preserved between them so the code doesn't change the feeling too much, as is the solarized color scheme.
